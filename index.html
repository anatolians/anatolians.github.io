Anatolian Shepherds and Kangals are often confused with each other, but they are distinct breeds, though closely related. Here are the key differences:
</br></br><b>Origin and History:</b> Both breeds originated in Turkey, but they come from different regions. The Kangal is specifically from the Kangal district of Sivas Province, while the Anatolian Shepherd is a more general term for dogs of this type from across the Anatolian Plateau.
</br></br><b>Breed Recognition:</b> The breed recognition varies between countries. In some countries like the United States, the Anatolian Shepherd is recognized as a distinct breed, while the Kangal is often considered a variation of the Anatolian. However, in other parts of the world, including their native Turkey, the Kangal is recognized as a separate breed.
</br></br><b>Physical Characteristics:</b> While they are similar in size and appearance, there are subtle differences. Kangals tend to have a more uniform coat color, often fawn with a black mask, and are slightly larger with a more muscular build. Anatolian Shepherds have a wider range of coat colors and may be less uniform in appearance.
</br></br><b>Temperament:</b> Both breeds are known for their guarding abilities, but their temperaments can differ slightly. Kangals are often described as more reserved and serious, particularly when on duty, while Anatolians might show a bit more versatility in their roles, being both livestock guardians and more integrated into family life.
</br></br><b>Purpose and Working Style:</b> Both are livestock guardian dogs, but their working styles can differ. Kangals are known for their strength and bravery, often confronting predators directly. Anatolians are also protective but might be more prone to using intimidation and barking to ward off threats before resorting to physical confrontation.
</br>In summary, while Anatolian Shepherds and Kangals share a lot of similarities due to their common heritage, they are considered distinct breeds, with differences in appearance, temperament, and to some extent, working style. The distinction can be more pronounced based on the standards of different canine organizations around the world.
</br>We raised our Anatolians as pets; though, calling them pets is a disservice... an insult. They
                        are companions in the deepest sense.

                        </br>
                        Anatolians make amazing family companions. However, they are not for everyone. If you want an
